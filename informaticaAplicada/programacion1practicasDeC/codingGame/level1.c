Storyline:
You work in NASA, and must check if the rocket will reach Mars

The Problem:
You must create a program to calculate if rocket will reach Mars

Criterion of a Failing rocket:
- If velocity multiplied by the time is less than distance to Mars
- If fuel multiplied by the fuel consumption is less than distance

Notes:
    If there is less time, print 'Failure, Not enough time'
    If there is less fuel, print 'Failure, Not enough fuel'
    If both only print 'Failure, Not enough time'
    If rocket is successful, print 'Welcome to Mars'
    time will be in hours
    fuel will be in liters
    fuel_consumption will be in distance per 1 liter of fuel
    distance will be in kilometers
    Input
    time: Integer
    fuel: Integer
    fuel_consumption: Integer
    distance: Integer
    Output
    answer: String
    Constraints
    0 < fuel, fuel_consumption, distance, velocity, time < 1001

    Example
    Input
    1000
    10
    10
    100
    100
    Output
    Failure, Not enough time
